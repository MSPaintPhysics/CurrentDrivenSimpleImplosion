# CurrentDrivenSimpleImplosion
This is a current driven "0-D" implosion model of a cylindrical liner.  Current driven here means the current pulse is independent from the liner dynamics.  It is setup for a solid aluminum liner but can easily be modified by changing the density and thickness of the liner in the liner parameters section.
